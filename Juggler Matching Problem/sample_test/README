/////////////////////////////////////TEST PROGRAM///////////////////////////////////////////


This folder contains following files for a particular test case
where I believe circuit assignments cannot be made without violating
the constraints and hence that juggler remains free without any circuit
alloted to him. in this case juggler(16):


Files:

1).circuit.txt
   This file consist of H E and P values for each circuit
   separated by "," delimiter. Each row represent one circuit.
   There are 10 circuits overall.

2).juggler.txt
   This file consist of H E and P values for each juggler
   separated by "," delimiter. Each row represent one juggler.
   There are 30 jugglers overall.

3).preferences.txt
   This file consist of the circuit preferences given by a
   juggler to circuits in decending order separated by ",".
   each row represents a juggler and his preferences.There
   are 30 juggler preferences in all. Each juggler gives 5
   preferences. I have taken care to make the preference dis-
   tribution uniform to a large extent covering all circuit, 
   except the cases which I wanted to test the logic for.

4).sample_result.txt
   this file consist of inital and final allotments made to 
   the circuits. Comments have been provided to assist further.

5).sample_output.txt
   this is the main control flow file which tests various aspects
   of allocation and constraint checking for the example given. Step
   by step analysis has been provided for checking the allocations    
   in a circuit at a given point in time and how the program reaches 
   to its final conclusion.


The logic that I have used for grouping has been explained in the section where I 
submit my code. I believe it to be correct, but I may be wrong. In case you find a 
fault please correct me and give a feedback.
