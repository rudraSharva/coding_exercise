This folder consist of 3 subfolders:

1). Example on webpage: gives my test resuly on the example problem
    given on your website, to which my logic in the program complies
    to. Results can be cross checked.

2). Sample test: In this folder I have mentioned a test case for which
    I believe juggler cannot be assigned to any circuit without violating
    the preference and weight constraints which are essential to the needs
    of the problem statement. A step by step analysis and description of 
    that test case has been provided by me. This I did because I am getting
    some jugglers in the main input file which are not being classified to
    any circuit (about 80 or so). To crosscheck this I have made this example.

3). Final_program: This folder consist of the actual problem input.txt, outputs
    and associated code files with explanation
